      <description>Sometimes you need to rename and &amp;ldquo;sanitize&amp;rdquo; a bunch of files in a directory.
For me, I had to do things like:
 Remove spaces. Remove apostrophes, commas, etc In some cases, remove a trailing &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo;  Seemed to be a perfect opportunity to get to know golang a little better.
Hat-tip to this helpful page on working with files in golang.
Just be sure to change the directory to the one you want.</description>
