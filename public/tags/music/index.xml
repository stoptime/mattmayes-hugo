      <description>I joined this band after responding to their add in the Chicago Reader, looking for a drummer. I was pretty much a kid out of school, and these guys really showed me around the whole Chicago scene. We played about every club/bar/venue in the area, and eventually headed over to Europe for a 3 week tour after our first album was released (40k - with the red cover).
While working on our second album, the band got derailed a bit, and we never got to the final polishing/release stages.</description>

      <description>Jazz Conspiracy was born out of the Bloom School of Jazz - where many of us met, studied, practiced - and eventually performed at the Jazz Showcase. We were an actively gigging/recording band from about 2003-2010 or so, being regularly featured for entire weekends at Pops for Champagne.
Below are some of my favorite tracks - you can listen to all of them for free over at SoundCloud .
 The Musicians  David Beazley(piano) Marc Piane (acoustic bass) Matt Mayes (drums) Thomas Mucha (trumpet) Trent Harris (saxphones) </description>
