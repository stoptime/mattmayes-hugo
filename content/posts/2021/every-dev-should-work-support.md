Don't get me wrong - I don't mean the mind-numbing "tech support" that typically comes to mind. Rather, I'm talking about onboarding a new developer through debugging and reverse engineering. If you are a mid to senior level devoloper/engineer - I think this is a great way to learn about the things you will be working on.

I've just ended a 4 year stint as a Senior Support Developer - before that I was a site developer (at the same company), and was pretty happy in that initial role. Taking specs and ideas and turning them into reality is something I enjoy doing and have lots of experience in. So when I got moved into a struggling support team, I was a bit... hesitant? Confused? Yes and yes.

## The Bigger Picture becomes much clearer

Said company is in the publishing industry, and has a pretty complex infrastructure. Lots of services meshed both our old and new products together. Little did I realize that while building sites was cool - it was actually a very small part of what we did.

I learned there was so much more going on outside of my little LAMP bubble. Services I previously had a casual awareness of were suddenly forefront. I saw the patterns, our pain points, along with what our clients strugged with, and what new features they wanted. I became very familiar with our most popular product offering, and in doing so my debugging skills leveled up. Soon I wasn't just a site-specific, LAMP-based debugger, but a platform debugger. Then I started being able to fix some of the platform bugs I was reporting. Then I started building new features into our core product - features I knew our clients wanted because I was hearing it directly from them. In a way I had circled back to building, at least at times.

### But Developers like to Develop

As much as I learned from and enjoyed my tenure on the support team (or as they say, _Customer Success_) - I am the type of person who enjoys making things, exploring ideas, and learning new languages and concepts. After another round of company restructuring, it became clear that I was on the support team... for good. All platform work was moved out of the support team to to new hires, who, guess what, could have benefitted from spending a few months in support. Anyways, having to solve problems day in and out was becoming my new reality. Don't get me wrong, I love solving problems - but a developer _needs to write code_.

That said I would recommend an onboarding process that involves spending time in a support/debugging role to about anyone who codes for a living. If you have the curiousity and determination it will pay dividends, _and make you a better developer_. ✌️
