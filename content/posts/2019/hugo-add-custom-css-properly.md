So you've picked out and installed your [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme, but you just need to tweak a few things here and there, yet you don't see a config setting that allows you add your own css file(s) in config.toml ðŸ‘Ž 

In addition to adding your own css file, wouldn't it be great if they were minimized and had the [integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) set too? 

> Just to note, I'm using the latest version of the [hyde-hyde](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-hyde/) theme as an example, and Hugo version v0.61.0/extended.

First thing you need to do is dive into your theme, and figure out what layout file is responsible for outputting the css links. In hyde-hyde, that's:

`my-site/themes/hyde-hyde/layouts/partials/header/styles.html`

Now, in your "regular" non-theme directory, you need to recreate that exact path and file - making directories if you need to:

`my-site/layouts/partials/header/styles.html`

And add the following highlighted lines to it:

```go {linenos=table,hl_lines=[4, "12-15"]}
{{ partial "header/styles-highlight.html" . }}

{{ $options := (dict "outputStyle" "compressed" "enableSourceMap" true) }}
{{ $optionsCss := (dict "outputStyle" "compressed") }}

{{ $style := resources.Get "scss/hyde-hyde.scss" | toCSS $options | fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $style.RelPermalink }}" integrity="{{ $style.Data.Integrity }}">

{{ $printStyle := resources.Get "scss/print.scss" | toCSS $options | fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $printStyle.RelPermalink }}" integrity="{{ $printStyle.Data.Integrity }}" media="print">

{{ range .Site.Params.customCss -}}
{{ $customStyle := resources.Get . | toCSS $optionsCss | fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $customStyle.RelPermalink }}" integrity="{{ $customStyle.Data.Integrity }}">
{{- end }}
```

You may notice we are iterating over a range of values - this means we can have more than 1 custom css file :)

Now we need to tell our config file about it, so in your config.toml we add:

```toml
## Site Settings
[params]
    customCss = ["css/custom.css"]
```

I am only add one here, but you can added more like `["css/foo.css", "css/bar.css"]` or whatever.

Now, the trick with `resources.Get` is that it seems to only look in folders named "assets" - so make this:

`my-site/assets/css/custom.css`

Now you should be good to go! Just add more files as needed. 

### What I do NOT know
Is how to get this bundled into the main scss/css compiling, so we only have a single, minified css file...
