I've also drummed, arranged and recorded several tunes with Jazz Conpiracy (you may have seen us at on of our weekly gigs at Pops or the original Metropolis coffee shop), and Ether Frolics, who where lucky enough to tour Germany, Austria, and Switzerland - in addition to playing some of the great Chicago clubs, some of which no longer exist.

I also enjoy brewing, playing guitar, & bbq'ing several times a week, weather be damned. You can often find me working on the endless home projects that come with owning a 100 year old Chicago two-flat.

My wife and two noisy cats offer running commentary.
