This is my second technical blog, though I never stopped working in the tech industry - I needed a blogging break, and wanted to start fresh and under my own name. This might not even be a _purely_ technical blog.

For example, outside of tech I've drummed, arranged and recorded several tunes with [Jazz Conpiracy](/jazzconspiracy) and [Ether Frolics](/etherfrolics). The Frolics were lucky enough to tour Germany, Austria, and Switzerland - in addition to playing the great Chicago clubs, some of which no longer exist. After that, Jazz Conspiracy ruled the [Pops for Champagne](https://www.popsforchampagne.com/) scene in both their original and second location. During and after JC, I was also a hired-gun for other bands. These days I just keep a drum kit and guitar next to my desk.

I also enjoy brewing, playing guitar, & bbq'ing several times a week, weather be damned. You can often find me working on the endless home projects that come with owning a 100 year old Chicago two-flat.

My wife and two noisy cats offer running commentary.
