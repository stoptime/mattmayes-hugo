This is my second technical blog after a break for awhile. It might not even be a _purely_ technical blog, as you explore you'll see some other stuff.

For example, I've also drummed, arranged and recorded several tunes with [Jazz Conpiracy](/jazzconspiracy) and [Ether Frolics](/etherfrolics). The Frolics were lucky enough to tour Germany, Austria, and Switzerland - in addition to playing the great Chicago clubs, some of which no longer exist.

I also enjoy brewing, playing guitar, & bbq'ing several times a week, weather be damned. You can often find me working on the endless home projects that come with owning a 100 year old Chicago two-flat.

My wife and two noisy cats offer running commentary.
